RT - Need to be able to add an entry to a table. 
RT - Need to be able to match a table against a computed match key (Creating match key already done)

Compile actions into a dict of named functions in P4.
These would include the primitive actions.
User-specified actions would just be added to the set of default primitive actions.

Need a runtime system to add entries and process packets!


DONE
- handle set_metadata
- Tests must check extracted hdrs to verify values.
- switch return tests: check 'default' 
- switch return tests: check 'mask'
- handle return switch in parser functions
- Compile 'length' definitions
- Handle '*' in bit_width   (requires 'length' to be handled.)
- Handle max_length
- Implement : Packet Processing and Control Flow
- Allow hex constants (0x[0-9A-Fa-f]+)
- Check if-then-else for control func
- check bool_exprs for control func
- create function to construct the match value from headers. (the "reads" stmt )
- Implement : Table Declaration
- check table actions are defined when runtime commences.
- Implement : Action Definitions

- RT - Need to be able to add a default action to a table.
